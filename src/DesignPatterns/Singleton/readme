Real world example implement with singleton design pattern
Grammar Checking :

with singleton design pattern:
In a Grammar Checking system implemented with the Singleton design pattern,
we ensure that there is only one instance of the GrammarChecker class shared across the entire
application. This ensures efficient resource usage and consistent grammar checking
throughout the application. It's particularly useful when multiple parts
of the application need to access and use the same grammar checking service.


without singleton design pattern:
In a Grammar Checking system implemented without the Singleton pattern,
each part of the application might create its own instance of the GrammarChecker class
when needed. This can lead to multiple instances, potentially consuming more resources
and causing inconsistencies in grammar checking rules and data.
