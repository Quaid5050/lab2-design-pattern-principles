HighCohesion Software Design Principle
real world example of the Books Management

with the HighCohesion Software Design Principle
In the Book class all methods are related to the Book class, so the Book class is highly cohesive.
no other unrelated methods are added to the Book class.


without the HighCohesion Software Design Principle
in the book class some methods are related to the Book class and some methods are not related to the Book class.
so the Book class is not highly cohesive.
