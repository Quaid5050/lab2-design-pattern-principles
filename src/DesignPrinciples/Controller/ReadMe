Real world problem : Book management system

with controller principle
In with controller principle we have to create a controller for each entity.
So we have to create a controller for book they are validate th data and in th get the data from
the model and send it to the view.
also get the data from viw then validate it and send it to the model.

without controller principle
there is no controller that validate the bussiness logic and handle the errors in this  direct communication between model and view.
