Information expert principle of grasp :
Real world problem : Library Management System


With Information Expert:

The code with the Information Expert principle adheres to the GRASP design principle by ensuring
that each class (e.g., Library and Book) is responsible for managing its own information and operations.
This promotes encapsulation and a clean, modular design, where classes possess the most knowledge about their related data.

Without Information Expert:

In contrast, the code without adhering to the Information Expert principle violates GRASP principles.
It centralizes knowledge and operations that should be distributed across classes, resulting in a less modular and less encapsulated design.
For example, the Library class is no longer responsible for managing its books, leading to a less maintainable and less organized codebase.
In library class we create the book class object and add books from the library class.
